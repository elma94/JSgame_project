# Javascript game project

Javascript game project was one of the mandatory tasks for the programming academy.

I choose to write a game code using HTML5 canvas element to draw graphics, together with some vanilla javascript functionalities.
The game is classic platformer, in which you navigate small character (t-rex in this case) to climb up to the last available platform on the screen.
If it fails to climb, the game is over. Character falls down into the lava floor.

Biggest challenge for me as a newbie in web development, was to write proper function to terminate the game when character falls down from the platform.
